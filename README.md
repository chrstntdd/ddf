## Why

I wanted to try out Ocaml 5 and with the new stable `eio` library. Also, clearing out `node_modules` and other build artifacts with `rm -rf` takes too long for me.

## Setup

1. [Install `opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
2. Create a local switch with `opam`
   ```sh
   opam switch create . --locked --deps-only
   ```
3. Install dependencies from the lockfiles.
   ```sh
   opam install ./lib.opam.locked ./bin.opam.locked ./ddf.opam --deps-only --locked
   ```
4. Build with `dune`
   ```sh
   dune build bin
   ```

For production, be sure to include the release flag:

```sh
dune build --profile release bin
```

## Development

Run `dune` in watch mode to get a fast development feedback loop.

```sh
dune exec bin/main.exe --watch -- --help
```

## Execution

Once the built with `dune`, you can invoke the executable directly:

```sh
./_build/default/bin/main.exe --help
```

or with `dune`

```sh
dune exec/bin/main.exe -- --help
```

If you are consuming the binary from the build artifacts, ensure you allow the `main.exe` to be executable:

```sh
chmod +x main.exe
```

## Prior art

- [`rip`](https://github.com/nivekuil/rip)
- [`mvf`](https://github.com/chrstntdd/mvf)
  The first prototype of this same functionality in ReasonML without the nice CLI. If I can ever get the build tooling right, it would be nice to have Pastel back in the mix somehow. Maybe a single module for rendering CLI output prompts in ReasonML with native jsx? ðŸ¤”
